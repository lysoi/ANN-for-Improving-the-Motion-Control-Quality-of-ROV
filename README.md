# Artificial Neural Network for Improving the Motion Control Quality of Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle

This Project introduces a Fuzzy Adaptive Control (AFC) system that dynamically adjusts ROV motion based on input error. 
Additionally, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhances the AFC parameters through self-learning, improving ROV control in current-affected environments. 
Experimental scenarios using MATLAB demonstrated that ANNs markedly improve control accuracy and overall performance for ROVs when following predetermined trajectories.
